# Course outline and handbook for HLTH403: Environmental Health

## Description of the course

Environmental health is an integral aspect of the health of a community. Risks to environmental health include pollution, unsafe foods, and infectious diseases, and many of these risks are increasing as a result of growing populations globally, and the effects of climate change. This course provides the foundation for students to understand environmental health.HLTH403 is a post-graduate course in environmental health offered in the second semester and aimed at students of public health.

This is a 30-point (0.25 EFT or Equivalent Full Time) course. 
This means if you are enrolled in this course, 
you are expected to spend 20 hours per week, 
or on an average 4 hours per day reading and researching about Environmental Health. 
We have three assignments for you to show your competence and mastery of the topics. 
This course is also a **required course of study** if you are enrolled in MHealSc at the School of Health Sciences and have opted for an endorsement in Environmental Health.

We cover three concepts in this course:

- Environmental Epidemiology, the "basic science" of Environmental Health
- Toxicology, to understand the biological basis of how environmental and health aspects are interconnected
- Environmental Health Risk Assessment, the procedure that brings together the concepts of Environmental Epidemiology and Toxicology together

## Learning outcomes
