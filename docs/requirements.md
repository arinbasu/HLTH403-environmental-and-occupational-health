## Notes on configuring your computer and software

We will use the following software for this course. Please note and configure before coming to the class or joining via videoconference

- Please bring to the class (by "bring to the class" I mean BOTH when you are online and offline) a notebook computer. 
- If you choose to use ipad/chromebook/android tablet/surface tabs, make sure you have access to an external keyboard
- Do not use your cellphone. Your cellphone will not be adequate for the several computer based exercises we will do
- Before coming to the class, make sure your device is fully charged. We may or may not have charging ports in the class
- If possible, bring a portable charger as if your devices loses charge in the middle of the class, a portable chargeer might be useful
- If you have to charge your device, please charge it during the long breaks (lunch and short tea breaks)

## Software requirements

- Please make sure your computer has either Google Chrome/Brave/Firefox/Safari/Edge (latest update)

## UC Jupyter notebook
- We will use jupyter notebook for this course. You will be able to follow along the exercises in the classroom using this tool.
- As it is a web based tool, 
you can access everything using your web browser.
- I have created user accounts for you 
- Your username is your UC username, and your password is your student ID number. 
- The login url for this is: 

[https://jupyterhub.canterbury.ac.nz/teaching/](https://jupyterhub.canterbury.ac.nz/teaching/user/arinbasu/lab)

It will prompt you to enter your username and password.
If you correctly enter your username and password,
you will be able to enter the site.
