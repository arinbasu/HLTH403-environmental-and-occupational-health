# Course outline and handbook for HLTH403: Environmental Health

## Description of the course

Environmental health is an integral aspect of the health of a community. Risks to environmental health include pollution, unsafe foods, and infectious diseases, and many of these risks are increasing as a result of growing populations globally, and the effects of climate change. This course provides the foundation for students to understand environmental health.HLTH403 is a post-graduate course in environmental health offered in the second semester and aimed at students of public health.

This is a 30-point (0.25 EFT or Equivalent Full Time) course. 
This means if you are enrolled in this course, 
you are expected to spend 20 hours per week, 
or on an average 4 hours per day reading and researching about Environmental Health. 
We have three assignments for you to show your competence and mastery of the topics. 
This course is also a **required course of study** if you are enrolled in MHealSc at the School of Health Sciences and have opted for an endorsement in Environmental Health.

We cover three topics in this course:
- Environmental Epidemiology, the "basic science" of Environmental Health
- Toxicology, to understand the biological basis of how environmental and health aspects are interconnected
- Environmental Health Risk Assessment, the procedure that brings together the concepts of Environmental Epidemiology and Toxicology together

## Learning outcomes
Students who successfully complete this course will:

- Demonstrate mastery of their knowledge and skills to investigate and address health problems that have origins in the physical, chemical, and social environments 
- Critically appraise a range of literature on Environmental conditions as source of illnesses and burden of disease
- Design studies to address environmental health related problems
- Demonstrate understanding of the larger community based issues related to Environmental sources of illness

## University Graduate Attributes Addressed
- Analytical, critical thinking and problem-solving in diverse contexts (GA1: Employable, innovative and enterprising)
- Treaty of Waitangi and Aotearoa NZ's bicultural history (GA2: Bicultural Competence and Confidence)
- Other indignenous models of development (GA2: Bicultural competence and confidence)
- Understanding the global nature of Environmental Health (GA3: Globally aware)
- Application: Understanding and articulating how the content of Environmental Health enhances the community (GA4: Community Engagement)

## Assessments
There are two assessments for this course, each worth 50% and each assessment address all five goals. These include environmental health risk assessment (Goals 1 and 2), environmental epidemiology (Goal 3), toxicology (Goal 4) and environmental health issues (Goal 5).

### Assessment I: Presentation of an Environmental health topic  (50%)
This will be a presentation by the student on an Environmental Health Issue. **The due date/time the due date is 21/8, and the presentations will be given in the afternoon, from 1.00 – 3.00pm**. In this assessment, the student will identify an Environmental Health issue of their own choice, and develop a presentation (using PowerPoint or pdf) on the issue, and answer questions from the audience. The presentation will be about 10 minutes and 5 minutes of questions and answers. The students will be marked out of 50 based on the presentation and the way they answer questions from the audience.

### Assessment II: Writing a review paper or a report in the correct form for a specific scientific journal (50%)
Building on the presentation, the student will write their presentations up as either a scientific paper (a review) using a particular journal's instructions for authors, or write it up as an article suitable for publication in a newspaper. The purpose will be to test the science communication skills of the student.
