# Syllabus for HLTH403: Environmental Health: Syllabus and Timetable

## Description of the course

HLTH403 is a post-graduate course in environmental health offered in the second semester and aimed at students of public health or students with endorsement in Environmental Health. The course will provide students with knowledge and skills to investigate and address health problems that have origins in the physical, chemical, and social environments and the means to study and address these problems.
From the course description at the UC course information systems,

> “Environmental health is an integral aspect of the health of a community. Risks to environmental health include pollution, unsafe foods, and infectious diseases, and many of these risks are increasing as a result of growing populations globally, and the effects of climate change. This course provides the foundation for students to understand environmental health.”

## Assessments
There are two assessments for this course, each worth 50% and each assessment address all five goals. These include environmental health risk assessment (Goals 1 and 2), environmental epidemiology (Goal 3), toxicology (Goal 4) and environmental health issues (Goal 5).

### Assessment I: Presentation of an Environmental health topic  (50%)
This will be a presentation by the student on an Environmental Health Issue. **The due date/time the due date is 21/8, and the presentations will be given in the afternoon, from 1.00 – 3.00pm**. In this assessment, the student will identify an Environmental Health issue of their own choice, and develop a presentation (using PowerPoint or pdf) on the issue, and answer questions from the audience. The presentation will be about 10 minutes and 5 minutes of questions and answers. The students will be marked out of 50 based on the presentation and the way they answer questions from the audience.

### Assessment II: Writing a review paper or a report in the correct form for a specific scientific journal (50%)
Building on the presentation, the student will write their presentations up as either a scientific paper (a review) using a particular journal's instructions for authors, or write it up as an article suitable for publication in a newspaper. The purpose will be to test the science communication skills of the student.
